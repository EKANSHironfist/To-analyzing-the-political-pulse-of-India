2013-11-03 05:43:05+00:00,ShashiTharoor,Great to be back home for Diwali. Just landed from a magical but all-too-brief visit to Bhutan. @sptvrock was constantly reminded of Kashmir
2013-11-02 18:49:03+00:00,ShashiTharoor,@gauravmridu you are right. Still can't get used to the Sir culture. At the UN we called bosses by their 1st names. Respect lies in conduct!

2013-11-01 09:57:06+00:00,ShashiTharoor,@nandtara warmly reciprocated! What matters is that we stand up for the right values in our country. Thanks for your support
2013-11-01 09:53:41+00:00,ShashiTharoor,@chaitanyadj nope. Am driving to Bhutan to deliver a lecture on democracy &amp; development at Royal Institute for Governance&amp;Strategic Studies
2013-11-01 09:50:13+00:00,ShashiTharoor,@DKMahant the anti-Sikh violence in 1984 remains a blot on our collective conscience. Our failure to identify&amp;convict the killers is a shame
2013-11-01 03:52:08+00:00,ShashiTharoor,@jonathanshainin agreed (I've benefited from this2 in the US). But novelists aren't entitled to their own facts. Fiction intrudes too often
